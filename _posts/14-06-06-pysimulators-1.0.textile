What's new ?
* New operator: @ConvolutionTruncatedExponentialOperator@
* An @Acquisition@ contains now a @Scene@, an @Instrument@ and a @Sampling@ instance
* MPI-fied @Acquisition@
* MPI-fied @Instrument@
* MPI-fied @PackedTable@
* @PackedTable@ improvements:
    - generic superclass for: @Scene@, @Layout@ and @Sampling@
    - instance attributes now correspond to the packed arrays. Unpacked arrays are available through the @all@ attribute
    - optimisation when no element is removed or when the packed elements are a slice of all the elements.
    - implement @__getitem__@
    - add @column@ and @row@ special attributes to @LayoutGrid@ as functions.
    - Add @startswith1@ keyword in @LayoutGrid@ to start column and row indexing from 0 or 1.

* Implement @FSCRot2dMatrix@ and @FSRRot2dMatrix@ sparse storage schemes.

* Add method @get_projection_nbytes@ to estimate the size of the pointing matrix without requiring to build it

* Implement @Instrument@ @__getitem__@ to select detectors

* Implement @Acquisition@ @__getitem__@ to select detectors and/or samplings

Under the hood:
* Orthogonalize the Galactic-to-Ecliptic rotation matrix to machine precision to avoid loss of precision when using the transpose for the inverse.
* Fix in get_noise, draw one realization per detector.
* For quantities with structured dtype, getitem should never make a copy.
* Implement projection's @restrict@ method in Fortran, to avoid large temporaries and significantly improve memory handling
