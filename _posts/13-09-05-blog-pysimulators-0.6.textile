What's new ?
* Use the Layout class in Instrument instances to represent the detectors. Remove nvertices attribute
* Add keywords commin and commout in Instrument's @__init__@ (instead of a single comm)
* Add convex_hull function in geometry.py, using scipy.spatial.Delaunay
* Add method get_projection_operator and abstract get_projection_matrix to the Acquisition class
* Implement Acquisition.get_noise and Acquisition.get_invntt_operator methods. Add file noises.py
* MADmap1 interface implementation

Under the hood:
* In Layout, handle all dtype's kinds for the unpacked removed value
* Switch off composition rule for ProjectionOperator and DiagonalOperator with rightward broadcasting
* In Acquisition, use instrument's communicators: comm_map -> commin and comm_tod -> commout
