excerpt: Install pysimulators package
---

<br>
The PySimulators package is under the "CECILL-B":http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html license, a BSD-like free software license, with a citation requirement. The source code and development is hosted at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators. The current version of the PySimulators package is {{ site.version_stable }}, and it is still in beta stage.

h1. Preparation

h2. The pip utility

The "pip":http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html program allows the installation of Python packages from the internet. It is recommended to use it instead of easy_install, which cannot uninstall packages. If @pip@ is not installed, but @easy_install@ is (or @easy_install-2.7@),  the latter can be used to install the former. First, check that @easy_install@ actually runs the Python interpreter you're using, by inspecting its first first line of code. Then, type

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo easy_install pip
{% endhighlight %}


h2. Gfortran

Some number-crunching parts are written in modern Fortran. Currently gfortran >=4.5 is required.

* on Linux/Ubuntu:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install gfortran
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X:

First, make sure that "Xcode":https://developer.apple.com/xcode and "MacPorts":https://www.macports.org are installed (and make sure that /opt/local/bin is in your @PATH@). Then search for and install the latest stable gcc version:

{% highlight bash %}
$ port search --glob "gcc??"
...skipped...
gcc47 @4.7.3_3 (lang)
    The GNU compiler collection

gcc48 @4.8.2 (lang)
    The GNU compiler collection

gcc49 @4.9-20140416 (lang)
    The GNU compiler collection, prerelease BETA

$ sudo port install gcc_select gcc48
$ sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc48
{% endhighlight %}

h2. The FFTW package

* on Linux/Ubuntu:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
$ sudo pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X, using the MacPorts Python interpreter:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install py-pyfftw
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X, using a non-MacPorts Python interpreter (such as Anaconda's or Enthought's):

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install fftw-3 fftw-3-long fftw-3-single
$ sudo CPATH=/opt/local/include LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

h1. Installation

h2. The easy way

The easiest way to download and install the PySimulators package is by using pip. It will fetch the package and its dependencies from the "Python Package Index":http://pypi.python.org/pypi and install them.

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install --user pysimulators
{% endhighlight %}

To upgrade the PySimulators package if it is already installed in the user site:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install --user --upgrade pysimulators 
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the @--upgrade@ option will attempt to uninstall the previously installed version. The whole process may fail if you don't have the proper permissions to do so.

h2. The Git way

You can also clone the Github repository, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators
$ pip install --user ./pysimulators
{% endhighlight %}

This method is convenient to test PySimulators' development branch but package dependencies must be installed beforehand (see the "setup.py":https://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators/blob/v{{site.version_stable}}/setup.py file for the list of requirements). The package can be updated by typing (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new):

{% highlight bash %}
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
{% endhighlight %}
