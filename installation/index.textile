excerpt: Install pysimulators package
---

<br>
The PySimulators package is under the "CECILL-B":http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html license, a BSD-like free software license, with a citation requirement. The source code and development is hosted at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators. The current version of the PySimulators package is {{ site.version_stable }}, and it is still in beta stage.

h1. Preparation

h2. The pip utility

The "pip":http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html program allows the installation of Python packages from the internet. It is recommended to use it instead of easy_install, which cannot uninstall packages. If @pip@ is not installed, but @easy_install@ is (or @easy_install-2.7@),  the latter can be used to install the former. First, check that @easy_install@ actually runs the Python interpreter you're using, by inspecting its first first line of code. Then, type

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo easy_install pip
{% endhighlight %}

h2. The FFTW package

The FFTW package and its Python wrapper need to be installed first.


* on Linux/Ubuntu, this will be something like:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
$ sudo pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X, using the MacPorts Python interpreter:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install py-pyfftw
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X, using a non-MacPorts Python interpreter (such as Enthought's):

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install fftw-3 fftw-3-long fftw-3-single
$ sudo CPATH=/opt/local/include LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Gfortran

Some number-crunching parts are written in modern Fortran. Currently gfortran >=4.5 is required.

* on Linux/Ubuntu:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install gfortran
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install gcc_select gcc47
$ sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc47
{% endhighlight %}


h1. Installation

h2. The easy way

The easiest way to download and install the PySimulators package is by using pip. It will fetch the package and its dependencies from the "Python Package Index":http://pypi.python.org/pypi and install them.

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install --user pysimulators
{% endhighlight %}

To upgrade the PySimulators package if it is already installed in the user site:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install --user --upgrade pysimulators 
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the @--upgrade@ option will attempt to uninstall the previously install version. The whole process may fail if you don't have the proper permissions to do so.

h2. The Git way

You can also clone the Github repository, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators
$ pip install --user ./pysimulators
{% endhighlight %}

This method is convenient to test PySimulators' development branch but package dependencies must be installed beforehand (see the "setup.py":https://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators/blob/v{{site.version_stable}}/setup.py file for the list of requirements). The package can be updated by typing (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new):

{% highlight bash %}
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
{% endhighlight %}
