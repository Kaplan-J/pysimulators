h1. {{ page.title }}

The PySimulators package is under the "CECILL-B":http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html license, a BSD-like free software license, with a citation requirement. The source code and development is hosted at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators. The current version of the pysimulators package is {{ site.version_stable }}, and it is still in beta stage.

h2. The easy way

The easiest way to download and install this package is by using the easy_install utility:

bc. sudo easy_install pysimulators

To upgrade an already installed PySimulators package:

bc. sudo easy_install --upgrade pysimulators

h2. The Git way

You can also clone the Github repository, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

bc. $ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/pysimulators.git
$ cd pysimulators.git
$ sudo python setup.py install

This method is convenient to test pysimulators' development branch. The package can be updated by typing (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new):

bc. $ git pull
Already up-to-date.
